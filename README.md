# Hourly-Plans

## This is an hourly planner that saves events incase you forget!
    - My motivation for this project were my low grades on past assignments. 

    - I built this project to demonstrate my knowledge and useage of Bootstrap and JavaScript

    - The problem it solves, is saving events, then given the current time displays if it is a PAST,PRESENT or FUTURE event.

    - The things I learned were implimenting moment.js, while able to bring a page to life with just basic HTML and propery JavaScript
